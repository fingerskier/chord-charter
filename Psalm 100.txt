{Verse 1}
     [IV]              [I]
Enter in through the gates
     [IV]              [I]
Enter in here and praise
     [IV]                          [VI] 
Come before him, come bring your song
          [IV]                [V]
We are His people, He is our God

For the Lord is good and His love endures
             [V]
His love endures
[IV]             [VI]                 [I]

His love endures

{Verse 2}
     [IV]          [I]
Enter into His courts

Enter in with grateful hearts

Come before him, come bring your song
         [IV]                 [V]
We are His people, He is our God

{Bridge}
[I]            [IV]
Raise Your voice
         [I]          [V]
Shout for joy all the earth
Am        [IV]
We sing a new song now
[I]       [V]
We sing a new song now
